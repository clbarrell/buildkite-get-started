# Buildkite Getting Started Example

[![Add to Buildkite](https://buildkite.com/button.svg)](https://buildkite.com/new?welcome)

This is an example repository that we're prepared for new users to quickly get a sense of how [Buildkite](https://buildkite.com/) pipelines work.

## How does it work?

You create a new pipeline in Buildkite using this repository and the first step will run the pipeline inside this repo in [.buildkite/pipeline.yml](.buildkite.com/pipeline.yml)

We've defined three sample tests to build, test and deploy a shiny new rocket to get you to the moon.
